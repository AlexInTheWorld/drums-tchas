# My name is DJ Hey!


Interactive drums' machine built as front-end project for FreeCodeCamp.

___User Story #1:___ I should be able to see an outer container with a corresponding `id="drum-machine"` that contains all other elements.

___User Story #2:___ Within `#drum-machine` I can see an element with a corresponding `id="display"`.

___User Story #3:___ Within `#drum-machine` I can see 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class name of drum-pad, a unique id that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: `Q`, `W`, `E`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Z`, `X`, `C`. The drum pads MUST be in this order.

___User Story #4:___ Within each `.drum-pad`, there should be an HTML5 `audio` element which has a `src` attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of `clip`, and an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent .drum-pad (e.g. `id="Q"`, `id="W"`, `id="E"` etc.).

___User Story #5:___ When I click on a `.drum-pad` element, the audio clip contained in its child `audio` element should be triggered.

___User Story #6:___ When I press the trigger key associated with each `.drum-pad`, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the `Q` key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string `Q`, pressing the W key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string `W`, etc.).

___User Story #7:___ When a `.drum-pad` is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the `#display` element (each string must be unique).
